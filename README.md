# Solution

## Overview

I've created a simple application, it wants to be as simple as possible, letting you to START and END without any distraction. When you want to track your time, the last thing you need is a tool that waste your time.
When you finish tracking an slot, you can start again or categorize the last time. This way you decide when spend time in categorizing your time.
The app have 3 categories predefined, but you can also add your own categories.
When you have time tracked, you can check how many time you spend in each category each day. Also you can check al your time slots past days.
