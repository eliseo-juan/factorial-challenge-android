# Factorial Mobile Challenge

Build a *time tracker* to track your daily activities.

**Bonus points** if:

* Groups data and shows statistics
* Looks nice and has good, natural interactions
* Stores the data on the cloud somewhere
* It is encouraged to build the app with React Native. Otherwise, if using native technologies, we
  prefer SwiftUI or Jetpack Compose
